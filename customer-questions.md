<quote>Question 1: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hello George

Thanks for your question, and I am very happy you have chosen to get started with Algolia.

Records:

Records will include your business information that you want your users to search on when interacting with your web site.

To get a little bit more technical, an Algolia record is a collection of attributes where each attribute has a name and a value (a key-value pair). This is explained in more detail in the documentation at the following link:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/
  
Question 2: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

Question 3: Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo
